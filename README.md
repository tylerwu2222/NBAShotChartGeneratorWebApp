# NBAShotChartGeneratorWebApp

A Flask web-app that uses the nba-api to pull shot chart information on active players in the current NBA Season.
The app works well on a local server, but I'm currently running into ReadTimeoutErrors on live. If/when the app is up and running, it will be available [here](https://nba-shot-chart-generator.herokuapp.com/):


If you clone this repository and follow the first few steps in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-build-a-web-app-using-pythons-flask-and-google-app-engine-52b1bb82b221) on running your app locally, you should be able to test out this app.
